# Notes

- try to analyze the cases of the problem (come up with test/ex/edge cases)
- figure out some kind of pattern, plan what data structure
- separate your thoughts case by case and implement that


- diction.get(key) returns None if key does not exist, directly  accessing that  would cause an error
