# Question patterns notice:

## Linked List

- node versus node.next
- curr = node means you have a pointer called curr pointing to node
- curr.next deals with what the node points to (pointer reference)
- curr.next = node means you're re-assigning what curr is pointing to
- None cannot point to anything

- something to check in the beginning (before everything else): if head is None
