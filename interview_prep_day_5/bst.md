# Binary Search Tree

- every node has at most 2 child nodes
- all nodes on left is less than parent node, nodes on right is greater than parent node
- every time you search for an element, eliminating search space by half
- serach complexity: O(log n)
- insert complexity: O(long n)

## Depth first search

- in order (left substree, left side then right side, then root, then right subtree, left side then right side)
- pre order (first root)
- post order (last root)
- referring with respect to base node
- (where you put your root node )
